Ch 1 Prob 3
    Given two strings, determine if one is a permutation of the other.
    
    JSK: This is a classic sort-the-string problem. I won't re-implement a sort here.

    Note: If arguments were read-only and we didn't want to pay a copy price, 
    populate a container, and properly compare, we could declare a [256] and count
    the number of times each ascii character shows up in the string.
