/*
Ch 1 Prob 2
    Implement an function void reverse(char* str) in C or C++ which reverses 
    a null-terminated string

    JSK: C-style strings are always null-terminated on any platform. This is 
    how the compiler knows the string had ended. So we don't have to declare
    "tmp\0" to tell it so.
